# Week 1-4: Display Current Date Exercise

## Displaying the Current Date and Appending Suffixes to a Days Variable

As a beginner in Python, I wanted to learn more about the datetime module and its various methods. I began by exploring the base functionality of the module and discovered how to obtain the current date, month, and year.

But I didn't stop there. I wanted to challenge myself by finding a way to append suffixes to the days of the month in a way that was both efficient and readable. I came up with a plan to create a control flow statement that would append the suffix "st", "nd", "rd", or "th" to the end of the day number.

At first, I wasn't sure how to use the method and module in conjunction with each other, but after researching and experimenting with various ways to implement my solution, I finally came up with a working code.

Through this challenge, I learned not only how to use the datetime module and its various methods, but also how to think critically and creatively when it comes to problem-solving in Python.
